val make : delta_time:float -> angular_freq:float -> damping_ratio:float -> t
(** [Spring.make ~delta_time ~angular_freq ~damping_ratio] creates a new
    spring that follows these parameters.

* `delta_time`: the time step to operate on. Game engines typically provide a way to determine the time delta, however if that's not available you can simply set the framerate with `1_000 /. fps`. Make sure the framerate you set here matches your actual framerate.

  * `angular_freq`: this translates roughly to the speed. Higher values are faster.

  * `damping_ratio`: the springiness of the animation, generally between `0` and `1`, though it can go higher. Lower values are springier.
